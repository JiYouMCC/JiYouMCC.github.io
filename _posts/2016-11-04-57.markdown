Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:


Triangle	 	T<sub>n</sub>=n(n+1)/2    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...

Pentagonal	 	P<sub>n</sub>=n(3n−1)/2    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

Hexagonal	 	H<sub>n</sub>=n(2n−1)    1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.

    import math


    def T(n):
        return (math.sqrt(8 * n + 1) - 1) % 2 == 0


    def P(n):
        return (math.sqrt(24 * n + 1) + 1) % 6 == 0


    def H(n):
        return (math.sqrt(8 * n + 1) + 1) % 4 == 0


    i = 144
    while True:
        h = i * (2 * i - 1)
        if T(h) and P(h):
            print h
            break
        i += 1

做完44，这题一点儿难度都木有:smile:
