Let $$S(n)$$ be the number of pairs $$(a,b)$$ of distinct divisors of nn such that aa divides bb.
For $$n=6$$ we get the following pairs: $$(1,2),(1,3),(1,6),(2,6)$$ and $$(3,6)$$. So $$S(6)=5$$.
Let $$pm#$$ be the product of the first mm prime numbers, so $$p2#=2∗3=6$$.
Let $$E(m,n)$$ be the highest integer $$k$$ such that $$2k$$ divides $$S((pm#)n)$$.
$$E(2,1)=0$$ since $$20$$ is the highest power of 2 that divides S(6)=5.
Let $$Q(n)=∑ni=1E(904961,i)$$
$$Q(8)=2714886$$.

Evaluate $$Q(1012)$$.
