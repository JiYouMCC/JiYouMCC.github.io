Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

|**37**|  36  |  35  |  34  |  33  |  32  |**31**|
|  38  |**17**|  16  |  15  |  14  |**13**|  30  |
|  39  |  18  |**5** |   4  | **3**|  12  |  29  |
|  40  |  19  |  6   |   1  |   2  |  11  |  28  |
|  41  |  20  |**7** |   8  |   9  |  10  |  27  |
|  42  |  21  |  22  |  23  |  24  |  25  |  26  |
|**43**|  44  |  45  |  46  |   47 |  48  |  49  |

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 ≈ 62%.


If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?

Prime list使用的场景也需要斟酌
